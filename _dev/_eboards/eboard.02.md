CSC 282.01, Class 02:  Common Unix tools
========================================

_Overview_

* Preliminaries
    * Notes and news
    * Upcoming work
    * Extra credit
    * Questions
* Detour: A coding challenge
* Exploring solutions to simple tasks
* Buffers (optional)

### News / Etc.

* Homework tends to depend on what gets accomplished in class.  I'll
  email you the homework and reading tonight.
* Not all of you are associated with the repo yet.
* Note: We're using mediocre git approaches in this class.  You can
  commit directly to the master branch of the primary repo.  (I enjoy
  seeing the chaos of file conflicts.)
* I'm trying a somewhat different approach to today's class.  We'll see
  how it goes.
* Remember to let me know when things seem broken on the Web site.
* Did my "essay" about buffers make sense or do I need to discuss more?

### Upcoming Work

*Forthcoming*

### Good things to do

* Events related to recent executive order.
* Hear from our marketing firm, 11:00 a.m. today in Harris Center Cinema.
* Hear from analytic support about current projects, 11:30 a.m. today in
  ARH 302.

### Questions

Detour: A coding challenge
--------------------------

*The following is presented as close to verbatim as I could make it to
ensure accessibility.*

Good morning.  Welcome to the Microgoogazonbok interview program.
As you know, we at Microgoogazonbook need large numbers of SWEs because
we chew them up like sunflower seeds.  However, we need them to be
competent so that they produce useful work before we spit them out.
You have indicated that you are "competent" C programmers and that you
have taken a reasonable number of undergraduate CS courses.  Today we
we will being by checking those claims.

At Microgoogazonbook, we deal with large amounts of data.  It's therefore
important that we have efficient searching procedures.  You should all
know the binary search procedure.

Suppose we have an array of a trillion items to search.  Approximately how
many values in that array do we expect binary search to visit?  *Calls
on candidate.*

Since we have limited time, we are going to ask you to implement binary
search on ordered arrays of integers with no duplicates.  The values
are ordered smallest to largest.

What do you expect the signature of that procedure to be?  *Calls on
candidate.*

Great.  We'll have you return the special value `-1` if the value is not
found in the array.  You can find more details in the repository.
You should all know how to use git and Github.  Download the project
from <https://github.com/Grinnell-CSC282/binary-search-2017S> and start
coding.  You may consult each other for help, or even work in pairs.
However, you may not Bingle or otherwise search the Web for answers.

You have until 8:30 a.m.  

Go!
