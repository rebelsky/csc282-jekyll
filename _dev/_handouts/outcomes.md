Intended learning outcomes
==========================

_At the end of each semester, I ask each class to make their own list of
learning outcomes for what they think they've taken away from the course
I tend to break the learning outcomes of the class down into a variety
of categories whose order seems to vary over time._

_This is my own list, which is clearly incomplete._
