## About this course

Welcome to the Spring 2017 session of Grinnell College's CSC 282.01,
a one-credit course entitled *Thinking in C and Unix*.  In this course,
we will explore the approaches that professionals take when developing
software using C in the Unix/Linux environments.  But we will also
delve more deeply into the underlying ways of thinking that guides
this practice.

There will be very little lecture in the class.  The focus will be on
collaborative exploration of problems and their solutions.  Each class,
I expect to suggest a problem and an approach and to have the class discuss
and experiment with alternatives.
