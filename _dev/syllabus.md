Syllabus
========

Welcome to {{ site.courseid }}! The official course description for this
class is:

> The most successful software designers master a variety of languages, algorithms, and software design methodologies. In this course, you will examine the Unix approach to software design. You will ground that examination, in part, by developing programs that deepen your understanding of advanced techniques of the C programming language. Includes laboratory work.

In other words, we will help you think in C and Unix/GNU Linux.

Learning Goals
--------------

Our major objectives for this course include:

  - Improving your overall software design skills
  - Enhancing your understanding of the C model of programming
  - Making you a more facile *nix user

Important Notices
-----------------

  - As is typical, I am over-booked this semester.  I apologize.
  - I am in the process of writing a series of essays on these subjects.
    I will likely ask you to read them.
  - I'm using new site development tools.  That means some things will
    be a bit wonky on the site.  Let me know what you find that's not
    in appropriate shape.

Accommodations and adjustments

-------

This course is offered for one credit and is graded as S/D/F.  College
guidelines dictate that one-credit courses rquire about three hours
per week.  All students who take the course are expected to

* attend at least eleven of the thirteen class meetings;
* do all of the assigned readings (about 30 minutes per week);
* spend an appropriate amount of time on each homework assignment (about
  90 minutes per week); and
* participate actively in class.

Students who meet these criteria will earn a grade of S.  Students who
do not will likely earn a lower grade.
