### News / Etc.

* Homework tends to depend on what gets accomplished in class.  I'll
  email you the homework and reading tonight.
* Not all of you are associated with the repo yet.
* Note: We're using mediocre git approaches in this class.  You can
  commit directly to the master branch of the primary repo.  (I enjoy
  seeing the chaos of file conflicts.)
* I'm trying a somewhat different approach to today's class.  We'll see
  how it goes.
* Remember to let me know when things seem broken on the Web site.

### Upcoming Work

*Forthcoming*

### Good things to do

* Events related to recent executive order.
* Hear from our marketing firm, 11:00 a.m. today in Harris Center Cinema.
* Hear from analytic support about current projects, 11:30 a.m. today in
  ARH 302.
