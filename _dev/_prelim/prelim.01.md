### News / Etc.

* Welcome to "Thinking in C and *nix".
    * The course has had a variety of titles.
    * I'll use at least one more, but I'll explain more later.
* I'm Sam (or SamR)
* I'll take attendance, mostly to make sure that I know everyone's name.
* Please sign up for a Github account and send me your username.
* As seems to be the norm in this department, I'm putting together a series
  of readings for this course.  They are definitely "a work in progress".
  Nonetheless, I'd like you to read the drafts.
