Introductory material
=====================

As seems to be the norm in this department, I'm putting together a series
of readings for this course.  They are definitely "a work in progress".
Nonetheless, I'd like you to read the drafts.

There are four parts to the introduction.  You should read all four.

* [A general introduction to the course and related writing project](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/musings/cnix-intro-1)
* [An introduction to thinking in C](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/musings/cnix-thinking-in-c)
* [An introduction to thinking in *nix](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/musings/cnix-thinking-in-unix)
* [Some of SamR's perspectives on software development](http://www.cs.grinnell.edu/~rebelsky/musings/cnix-thinking-like-sam) *Available Sunday night!*

You need not send reflections, but I do appreciate corrections and suggestions.
