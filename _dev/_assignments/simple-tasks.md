# Some simple *nix tasks

Note: The repository for this course is 
`https://github.com/Grinnell-CSC282/hw1-2017S`.

Find good solutions to each of the following tasks.  (That
is, write a program or command to solve the task.)  Put them in a folder
with your name in the GitHub repository.

* Given a DOS-formatted text file (lines end with \r\n rather than just
  \n), convert it to a standard text file.
* Given a standard text file, convert all uppercase letters to lowercase.
* Given a standard text file, remove all blank spaces at the end of lines.
* Make a list of all misspelled words in a text file.
* Given a CSV file in which each line has the form<br>
  `LastName,FirstName,Assignment,NumericGrade` <br>
  find the the five highest grades on homework 2.
* Given an HTML file, find the URLs of all images.  In case you don't
  know HTML, those will typically look like <br>
  `<img ... src="*URL*" ...>`
  + The `img` can have any capitalization (`img`,
    `IMG`, `Img`,  `iMg`, etc.)
  + There can be other text between the `img` and the
    `src`.  (That text cannot include a greater than sign.)
  + You may find it easier to start this problem by assuming that there's only one image tag on a line.
