# Unix tools

Note: The repository for this course is 
`https://github.com/Grinnell-CSC282/hw1-2017S`.

Make a list of *nix tools and utilities that you've found useful (or
even that you've just heard of).  Try to categorize and add a short
description.  Add at least two tools you've discovered to the `tools.md`
file in the repository.
